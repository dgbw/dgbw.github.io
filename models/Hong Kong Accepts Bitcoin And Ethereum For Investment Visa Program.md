# Hong Kong Accepts Bitcoin And Ethereum For Investment Visa Program  

Hong Kong has taken a groundbreaking step in cryptocurrency adoption by integrating Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) into its Capital Investment Entrant Scheme (CIES). This development positions the city as a global leader in blockchain-friendly immigration policies, offering high-net-worth individuals new pathways to residency while maintaining strict regulatory safeguards.  

## Key Requirements for Crypto-Based Applications  

To qualify for the investment visa program, applicants must meet the following criteria:  

- Maintain a minimum net worth of HK$30 million (~$3.8 million USD).  
- Provide verified proof of Bitcoin and Ethereum holdings through certified chartered accountants.  
- Invest the required HK$30 million in approved assets (excluding cryptocurrencies) post-approval.

## Crypto Asset Verification Process  

The Hong Kong government mandates rigorous verification for digital assets used in visa applications. Chartered accountants play a critical role in this process by:  

1. **Validating Ownership**: Confirming wallet addresses and transaction histories for BTC and ETH holdings.  
2. **Market Valuation**: Using real-time pricing data from licensed exchanges to determine asset value.  
3. **Documentation**: Issuing signed reports certifying the authenticity and value of digital assets.  

This framework ensures compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) regulations while accommodating the unique nature of blockchain-based wealth.  

### Case Study: Verification Workflow  

| Step | Action | Requirement |  
|------|--------|-------------|  
| 1 | Wallet Analysis | Provide complete transaction history for the past 12 months |  
| 2 | Price Confirmation | Use HKD-equivalent values from regulated exchanges (e.g., OKX) |  
| 3 | Accountant Certification | Submit signed valuation report with professional liability coverage |  

## Post-Approval Investment Restrictions  

While Bitcoin and Ethereum qualify for wealth verification, successful applicants must comply with traditional investment requirements post-approval. Acceptable assets include:  

- Government bonds and securities  
- Listed equities on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange  
- Real estate properties  

This dual-framework approach balances innovation with financial stability, ensuring visa recipients contribute directly to Hong Kong's conventional markets.  

## Strategic Implications for Hong Kong  

By embracing crypto assets for immigration, Hong Kong strengthens its position as Asia's premier blockchain hub. Key benefits include:  

- **Talent Attraction**: Drawing global blockchain entrepreneurs and investors  
- **Economic Growth**: Channeling crypto wealth into traditional financial sectors  
- **Regulatory Leadership**: Establishing a model for institutional-grade crypto adoption
