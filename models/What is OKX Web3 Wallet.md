As a decentralized wallet, security responsibility lies entirely with the user. Key precautions include:

2. **Strong Password Protection**: Create complex passwords and avoid sharing them. Wallets do not store passwords, making recovery impossible if forgotten.

Unlike traditional exchanges, OKX Web3 Wallet **requires no identity verification or account login**. Users can create or import wallets instantly and begin transacting without submitting phone numbers, emails, or personal documents.

## How to Backup Your Wallet

Proper backup procedures are crucial for asset security:

1. **Cloud Backup**: Utilize iCloud, Google Drive, or Huawei Cloud to store encrypted wallet data securely.

2. **Physical Storage**: Manually record recovery phrases or private keys on paper and store them in a safe location.

‚ùóÔ∏è **Critical Warning**: Losing your recovery phrase or private key results in permanent asset loss. Never share these credentials, as they grant full wallet access to anyone possessing them.
