### 05. UK Advances Stablecoin Oversight  
Following HM Treasury's 2024 mandate, the UK is finalizing rules for stablecoin issuers and service providers. The FCA's consultation period ends in 2025, with full implementation expected by 2026.  

### 06. Global Stablecoin Scrutiny Intensifies  
Jurisdictions worldwide are crafting stablecoin-specific laws. MiCAR sets the precedent for reserve audits and transparency, while the UK and Asia explore tailored regimes for payment-focused stablecoins.  

### 07. Data Governance Takes Center Stage  
As tokenization spreads, regulators demand stricter data accuracy standards. Blockchain platforms must now implement audit trails and access controls to mitigate fraud risks.  

### 08. AML/KYC Standards Strengthen  
FATF's Travel Rule enforcement expands globally. Crypto exchanges must now apply bank-grade transaction monitoring, with penalties for noncompliance escalating.

IOSCO and FATF propose extending securities laws to DeFi protocols. The "same risk, same regulation" principle gains traction, requiring decentralized platforms to implement KYC measures.  

### 10. Crypto Integration with Traditional Finance  
Regulatory sandboxes for security tokens proliferate. The EU and UK pilot blockchain-based government bond issuance, marking crypto's institutional-grade adoption.
