## Performance Comparison: Sonic vs Competitors

| Network       | TPS Capability | Consensus Type | Finality Time | Scalability Solution |
|---------------|----------------|----------------|---------------|----------------------|
| Sonic         | 10,000+        | Optimized PoS  | 1.5s          | Native L1            |
| Solana        | 6,500          | PoH + PoS      | 2-5s          | Native L1            |
| Ethereum      | 30             | PoS            | 15s           | L2 Rollups           |
| Polygon       | 65,000*        | PoS            | 2-3s          | L2 Scaling           |

*Note: Polygon's TPS requires L2 solutions

## Impact on AI-Driven Cryptocurrency Ecosystems

While Sonic's rebranding doesn't directly affect AI-specific tokens like AGIX or FET (which remained stable at $0.80 and $1.20 respectively), the enhanced transaction speed creates opportunities for AI applications:
- **High-frequency trading algorithms**: Reduced latency improves execution efficiency
- **Decentralized AI marketplaces**: Faster settlement enables real-time data transactions
- **Machine-to-machine payments**: Scalable micropayments infrastructure

However, direct correlation between Sonic's performance upgrades and AI token valuations remains unproven, indicating a need for further market development in this intersection.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: What technological advantages enable Sonic's superior TPS?
**A**: Sonic's optimized BFT consensus mechanism combined with parallel transaction processing architecture allows simultaneous validation of multiple transaction batches, reducing network congestion while maintaining security.

### Q: How does Sonic's rebranding affect existing Fantom projects?
**A**: The rebranding represents an evolutionary upgrade rather than a technical overhaul. Existing applications on Fantom maintain full compatibility with the new Sonic infrastructure through backward-compatible protocol updates.

### Q: What security measures accompany Sonic's performance enhancements?
**A**: Sonic implements a multi-layered security framework including:
- Randomized validator selection
- Quantum-resistant signature schemes
