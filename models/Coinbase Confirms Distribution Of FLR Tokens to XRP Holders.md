The Flare Network team and broader community expressed gratitude for Coinbase's confirmation. Hugo Philion, CEO of Flare Network, noted the importance of this partnership through official channels:

## Background on Distribution Delays

This confirmation comes after months of uncertainty regarding Coinbase's participation. On December 6, 2022, Philion revealed that Flare Network had not received formal communication from Coinbase about their distribution plans. This delay contrasted with other exchanges that had already distributed Songbird (SGB) tokens - Flare's testnet tokens - to eligible XRP holders.

Prominent crypto influencer Ben Armstrong (BitBoy Crypto) publicly questioned Coinbase's delayed distribution of SGB tokens, asking:  
> "Wait... Coinbase didn't give XRP holders their Songbird SGB token distribution? Uncle brian_armstrong, WHAT'S THE DEAL?"
