## Key Factors Influencing PEPEâ€™s Value  

### 1. Meme Cryptocurrency Market Dynamics  

The meme crypto sector, valued at over $88 billion, has evolved from humorous tokens to projects with dedicated communities and use cases. PEPE benefits from this trend, with demand driven by retail investors and social media virality.  

### 2. Token Burns and Supply Reduction  

In 2023, developers burned 50% of PEPEâ€™s supply (~210 trillion tokens) to create scarcity. Periodic community-driven burns continue to reduce circulating supply, enhancing value perception.  

### 3. Hard Fork Potential  

A potential blockchain fork could split PEPE into two networks, distributing new tokens to holders. While this might cause short-term volatility, it could also boost long-term interest.  

### 4. Exchange Listings  

Availability on major platforms like Binance and Kraken has amplified PEPEâ€™s visibility. A Coinbase listing, though unconfirmed, could catalyze further growth.  

### 5. Community and Social Media Influence  

A devoted community fuels PEPEâ€™s adoption. Active engagement on platforms like Twitter and Reddit drives organic growth, critical for meme crypto sustainability.
