## Preparation for Purchasing Cryptocurrencies with Amex  

Before initiating any transaction, ensure your Amex card and chosen platform align with your goals.  

### 1. Verify Card Compatibility  

Not all exchanges accept Amex cards. Key considerations include:

### 2. Prioritize Security  

Cryptocurrency investments require robust safeguards:  
- **Regulated Exchanges**: Opt for platforms with licenses (e.g., Coinbase, Gemini).  
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Enable apps like Google Authenticator or hardware keys.  
- **Secure Wallets**: Use hardware wallets (e.g., Ledger, Trezor) for long-term storage.

Some institutions may flag or block crypto-related transactions. Proactively communicate with your bank to avoid interruptions.
