## Trading Hours and Weekly Settlements

The platform operates **24 hours a day, 7 days a week**, with a critical exception: trading interruptions occur every **Friday at 16:00 UTC+8** during settlement periods. This 10-minute window (15:50–16:00 UTC+8) enforces specific restrictions:

| Activity          | Allowed? | Notes                          |
|--------------------|----------|--------------------------------|
| Opening New Positions | ❌       | Only closing positions permitted |
| Closing Positions    | ✅       | Full liquidity available       |

This mechanism ensures fair price alignment between perpetual contracts and underlying spot markets. Traders should pre-plan strategies to avoid execution risks during these intervals.

### 1. Opening Positions

- **Short (Sell to Open):** Expect price declines

### 2. Closing Positions

### Position Management Rules:
- **Automatic Merging:** Same-direction positions on identical contracts combine

## Risk Management in Perpetual Contracts

Effective risk mitigation requires understanding these key elements:

### 1. Leverage Usage
- **Recommended Range:** 5–20x for most traders
- **Caution Zone:** >50x leverage increases liquidation probability

### 2. Funding Rates
- Periodic payments between longs/shorts
- Calculated hourly based on price divergence

### 3. Liquidation Mechanics
- Triggered when margin falls below maintenance requirements
- Partial liquidations begin at 80% margin usage

**Best Practices:**
- Start with 10x leverage when learning
- Maintain 30%+ free margin for volatile periods
- Use stop-loss orders for automated risk control
