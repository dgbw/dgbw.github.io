## How Do Crypto Debit Cards Work?

Crypto debit cards operate by seamlessly converting digital assets into fiat currency during transactions. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Load Your Card:** Transfer cryptocurrencies from your wallet to the cardâ€™s linked account.  
2. **Real-Time Conversion:** At checkout, the card instantly converts crypto to fiat (e.g., USD, EUR) using the current exchange rate.  
3. **Merchant Payment:** The merchant receives payment in their local currency, unaware of the crypto origin.  

For example, if you buy a $100 item with a crypto card, the system deducts the equivalent value in Bitcoin from your wallet, factoring in real-time market rates and transaction fees.

### Virtual and Physical Options  
Most crypto cards offer **virtual versions** for online shopping and **physical cards** for in-store purchases. Many integrate with mobile wallets like Apple Pay or Google Pay for added convenience.

### FAQ: How Secure Are Crypto Cards?
